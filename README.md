#homebrew-pymontecarlo

This [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap provides formulae to install *pyMonteCarlo* programs on MacOS.

If you don't have Homebrew install, open a Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and copy/paste the following command:

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Then install the pymontecarlo tap:

`brew tap pymontecarlo/pymontecarlo`

Here is a list of available programs, which you can install using `brew install` (note: as the installation can take more than 10 minutes, use the verbose flag to see more detailed progress, `brew install -v`):
